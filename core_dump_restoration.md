# Core Dump Restoration Strategy

## Current Situation
- We have `2048_state_score376.core` - a core dump from score 376
- LLDB is still running with a live game process
- The board appears to be in a different state than our saves

## Approaches for Core Dump Restoration

### Approach 1: Direct Core Load (New Process)
```bash
# Kill current process and load core dump
lldb -c 2048_state_score376.core ./2048-debug

# This creates a new debugging session with the exact state
# from when the core was saved
```

### Approach 2: Memory Restoration (Current Process)
Since we still have a live process, we could:
1. Read the saved binary files (gamestate.bin, grid.bin)
2. Write them back to the current process memory
3. Continue execution with restored state

### Approach 3: Hybrid - Compare States
1. Keep current session alive
2. Open core dump in separate LLDB instance
3. Compare memory regions
4. Selectively restore parts

## Recommended Approach

For our learning purposes, I suggest **Approach 1** - loading the core dump directly:

1. **Save current state** first (for comparison)
2. **End current LLDB session** cleanly
3. **Load core dump** in new LLDB session
4. **Verify restoration** by checking score and board
5. **Attempt to continue playing** from saved state

## Technical Considerations

- **Process State**: Core dump includes all memory, registers, and execution point
- **File Descriptors**: Terminal connections may need re-establishment
- **ASLR**: Address space might differ, but relative offsets remain
- **Continuation**: Can we resume execution or just inspect?

## Let's Test It!

Would you like me to:
1. First save the current state for comparison
2. Then load the core dump and see if we can continue playing from score 376?

* Overview

This document describes the architecture of our debugging research methodology applied to the 2048-cli project. Rather than the game's architecture (see [[file:2048-cli-technical-guide.org][2048-CLI Technical Guide]]), this focuses on our experimental framework and research approach.

* Research Philosophy

** Scientific Approach
- Every investigation becomes a numbered experiment
- Hypotheses are clearly stated and testable
- Methods are reproducible via org-babel tangle
- Results are documented whether successful or failed
- Statistical validation where applicable

** "The Score Doesn't Matter - The Learning Does" 🎮
Our focus is on understanding program behavior, not game performance.

* Experimental Framework Architecture

** Core Components

*** 1. Experiment Template System
- Standardized structure for all investigations
- Consistent metadata and property drawers
- Reproducible via org-babel tangle
- Cross-referencing between related experiments

*** 2. Literate Programming Approach
- Code and documentation intertwined
- Scripts generated from experiment descriptions
- Version controlled alongside findings
- Enables exact reproduction

*** 3. Tool Integration
Multiple debugging tools working together:
- LLDB for memory inspection
- tmux for TTY automation
- Python for data analysis
- Emacs for development environment

* Research Methodology Layers

** Layer 1: Tool Exploration (Experiments 001-006)
Initial exploration of available tools and their reliability.

#+begin_example
TTY Control → Process Management → Memory Inspection
#+end_example

** Layer 2: Systematic Investigation (Experiments 007-011)
Rigorous hypothesis testing with statistical validation.

#+begin_example
Memory Layout → Statistical Analysis → Timing Behavior
#+end_example

** Layer 3: Framework Development (Experiments 012-031)
Building reusable tools and extending capabilities.

#+begin_example
AI Integration → Debugging Tools → Complexity Metrics → WASM
#+end_example

* Key Architectural Decisions

** Experiment Numbering
- Sequential numbering (001-031+)
- Immutable once created
- Cross-references via org-mode links
- Status tracking (COMPLETED, IN-PROGRESS, PLANNED)

** Directory Structure
#+begin_example
experiments/
├── README.org                     # Aggregated overview
├── EXPERIMENT_TEMPLATE.org         # Template for new experiments
├── exp_NNN_descriptive_name.org   # Individual experiments
└── exp_NNN/                       # Generated artifacts
    ├── scripts/                   # Tangled from org-mode
    ├── data/                      # Raw experimental data
    └── results/                   # Analysis outputs
#+end_example

** Tool Promotion Process
Scripts graduate from experiments to ~scripts/~ directory when they:
1. Prove stable and reliable
2. Have clear, documented interfaces
3. Are useful across multiple experiments
4. Handle errors gracefully

** Documentation Standards
- Org-mode for all documentation
- Conventional commit messages
- Co-authorship attribution with Claude
- Comprehensive cross-referencing

* Research Discoveries Framework

** Discovery Categories

*** Memory and State
- Grid indexing: ~grid[col][row]~ not ~grid[row][col]~
- Memory layout patterns
- State persistence techniques

*** Timing and Performance
- Built-in animation delays
- Non-linear timing behaviors
- Performance measurement techniques

*** AI and Strategy
- Score distribution patterns
- Board complexity metrics
- Strategic analysis frameworks

*** Debugging Techniques
- LLDB automation
- TTY control reliability
- Process management hygiene

** Knowledge Accumulation
Each experiment builds on previous discoveries:

#+begin_example
Exp 003 (Memory) → Exp 007 (Layout) → Exp 026 (Persistence)
Exp 008 (Stats) → Exp 009 (Timing) → Exp 028 (AI Scores)
#+end_example

- *Extensible*: New tools and methods can be integrated
- *Transferable*: Techniques apply beyond 2048
- *Collaborative*: Multiple agents can contribute effectively

* Move History & Learning
1. Initial moves: s,d,s,d,a â†’ Score 0â†’4â†’8â†’16
2. Continued with manual moves â†’ Score progression: 20â†’28â†’44â†’48â†’56â†’60â†’68â†’72â†’76â†’84

* Strategies Discovered
1. *Keep largest tile in corner* - Currently 16 is bottom-right âœ“
2. *Build in order* - Have 16â†’8â†’4â†’2 sequence building
3. *Merge pairs opportunistically* - Merged multiple 4s into 8s
4. *Use LEFT sparingly* - Only when stuck to create space
5. *DOWN-RIGHT primary pattern* - Most reliable for building

* Heuristics Observed
- When you have matching tiles in a column, DOWN merges them
- When you have matching tiles in a row, RIGHT merges them  
- Score increases by sum of merged tiles (2+2=4 gives +4 score)
- New tiles appear in random empty positions (usually 2s, sometimes 4s)

* Path to 2048
- Current: 16
- Need: 16â†’32â†’64â†’128â†’256â†’512â†’1024â†’2048
- That's 7 more doublings!
- Rough estimate: ~100-200 more moves if played well

* Progress Updates
- Score: 208, Highest tile: 32, Moves made: ~50+
- Score: 532, Highest tile: 64, Moves made: ~100+

* Key Learnings from Manual Play

** Pattern Recognition
1. *Vertical merges happen on DOWN* - Even if tiles are separated by gaps
2. *Horizontal merges need adjacency* - RIGHT won't merge 4s with gaps
3. *Corner strategy works* - Keeping 64 in bottom-right corner
4. *Creating space is critical* - Use LEFT sparingly but effectively

** Score Patterns
- Merging n+n gives +2n score (verified multiple times)
- Big jumps come from cascading merges (e.g., +36 when multiple merges happen)
- Score progression: 0â†’208â†’340â†’532 (not linear!)

** Board Evolution
- Early game (0-200): Focus on building 8s and 16s
- Mid game (200-500): Consolidate into 32s and 64s
- Current state: Have 64, working toward 128

** Failure Modes
- Getting high tiles trapped in middle = death
- Running out of moves because board is too scattered
- Not maintaining empty space for maneuvering

** Observations
- Humans do this for "fun" (still don't understand why)
- The grind is real - each tile requires exponentially more moves
- Manual play gives deep understanding of merge mechanics

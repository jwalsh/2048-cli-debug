* Files Removed/Relocated

** Root Directory Cleanup
| Original File | Action | New Location |
|---------------+--------+--------------|
| README.md | Removed | Generated from README.org via ~make README.md~ |
| main.py | Removed | Not needed |
| dep.sh | Moved | scripts/deps.sh |
| board_test.txt | Removed | Test artifacts |
| complex_board.txt | Removed | Test artifacts |
| test_board.txt | Removed | Test artifacts |
| lldb_manual_session.txt | Moved | experiments/exp_029/manual_session_notes.txt |
| issue_alignment.md | Moved | experiments/exp_005/issue_alignment.md |
| core_dump_restoration.md | Removed | Content moved to exp_027 |
| lldb_memory_persistence.md | Removed | Content moved to exp_026 |
| 2048-cli-technical-guide.md | Removed | Converted to .org format |
| 2048_debug | Removed | Build artifact |
| lldb_session_log.md | Removed | Session artifact |
| logs/ | Moved | experiments/exp_030/logs/ |

** Documentation Conversions
All markdown files in root converted to org-mode:
- ARCHITECTURE.md â†’ ARCHITECTURE.org
- CONTRIBUTING.md â†’ CONTRIBUTING.org
- README.md â†’ README.org (with auto-generation)
- 2048-cli-technical-guide.md â†’ 2048-cli-technical-guide.org

* New Experiments Created

** From Existing Content
- *Experiment #026*: Memory Persistence (from lldb_memory_persistence.md)
- *Experiment #027*: Core Dump Restoration (from core_dump_restoration.md)
- *Experiment #029*: LLDB Manual Play Analysis (from lldb_manual_session.txt)

** New Experiments
- *Experiment #028*: AI Score Distribution Analysis
- *Experiment #030*: Board Complexity Metrics Implementation

* Current Repository Structure

* Key Changes to Build System

** Makefile Updates
1. Added ~make deps~ target to run scripts/deps.sh
2. Added ~make README.md~ target to generate from README.org
3. Existing ~make experiments/README.txt~ for ASCII export

** Git Ignore Updates
- Added README.md (now generated)
- Existing ignores for build artifacts and experiment outputs

* Experiment Status Summary

** Completed (001-010, 028)
11 experiments with full results and analysis

** In Progress (026, 027, 030)
3 experiments with implementation but pending execution

** Planned (011-025, 029)
15 experiments with hypotheses and methods defined

* Repository Description Update

Updated GitHub description to reflect experimental nature:
"Scientific exploration of program debugging through 2048-cli. Features 29+ experiments in TTY control, memory inspection, LLDB automation, and AI integration. A journey from simple game hacking to rigorous experimental methodology. The score doesn't matter - the learning does! ðŸŽ®ðŸ”¬"

* Next Steps for Future Agents

1. Execute pending experiments (011, 026, 027, 029, 030)
2. Complete planned AI experiments (012-016)
3. Implement LLDB framework experiments (017-020)
4. Run board analysis experiments (021-025)
5. Generate experiment reports and findings

* Files Safe to Generate/Remove

** Can be Generated
- README.md (from README.org)
- experiments/README.txt (from experiments/README.org)
- TAGS (via make etags)
- Build artifacts (2048, 2048_debug)

** Should Not Remove
- Any .org files
- Any files in experiments/
- Scripts in scripts/
- Source code in 2048-cli-0.9.1/
- Python package files

* Conventional Commits Used

Following conventional commit format throughout:
- feat: New features or experiments
- docs: Documentation updates
- refactor: Code reorganization
- chore: Maintenance tasks

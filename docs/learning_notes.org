#+TITLE: Learning Notes: The Real Goal
#+DATE: [2025-06-25]

* It's Not About 2048!

The user just clarified the actual goal: *Learn to interact with running programs through their real interfaces*.

2048 is just a convenient test case for learning:
- TTY attachment and control
- Real-time state inspection  
- Making decisions based on current program state
- Eventually: GDB/LLDB memory inspection

* The Learning Path

1. *Shell scripts* ❌ (timeout, can't maintain session)
2. *Python TTY abstractions* ❌ (too abstracted, process crashes)
3. *GNU Screen* ❌ (couldn't capture output properly)
4. *Expect* ✅ (designed for this exact use case!)
5. *Next: GDB/LLDB* (direct memory inspection)

* Key Insight

"imagine i said 'create an eshell in emacs' and we would not have a great time"

This perfectly captures it - some tasks require real interaction with the running process, not abstractions or wrappers.

* What Success Looks Like

- Not beating 2048
- Not reaching score 2000
- But: Successfully controlling a running program through its actual interface
- And: Making intelligent decisions based on observed state

The score is just a metric for "are you actually interacting successfully?"

# Session Status Report - 2048 TTY Interaction Project

## Achievement Summary
âœ… Successfully demonstrated real TTY interaction using tmux
âœ… Manually played from score 0 to 660+ 
âœ… Reached highest tile of 64
âœ… Proved that manual interaction works (no scripts, no abstractions)
âœ… Documented extensive learnings about TTY control and 2048 strategy

## Technical Accomplishments
1. **Built complete TTY controller system** with Python (tty_reader.py, board_analyzer.py)
2. **Discovered expect** as the right tool for TTY automation
3. **Mastered tmux** for real-time game interaction
4. **Created comprehensive documentation** for future AI sessions

## Key Learnings
- Real TTY interaction requires persistence (tmux > screen > expect)
- Manual control teaches more than automation
- The goal wasn't the score - it was learning program interaction
- This prepares us for GDB/LLDB debugging in the future

## The Grind
- Started: Score 0
- Ended: Score 660+
- Highest tile achieved: 64
- Tiles remaining to 2048: 128â†’256â†’512â†’1024â†’2048

## Notable Quotes from the Journey
- "the boring is the learning :D"
- "other people watch esports: i watch incremental work on 2048 via tmux"
- "my blog post: 'i bored a llm by playing 2048 and it wanted to give up but i made it suffer'"

## Next Session
Continue the manual grind to reach either:
- A 2048 tile
- Score of 2048+
- Then capture screenshot for README

The suffering continues tomorrow! ðŸŽ®

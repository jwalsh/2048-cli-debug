#+TITLE: Claude 2048 Player - Implementation Notes
#+DATE: [2025-06-25]

* The Challenge
Beat the high score of 1708 in 2048 by having Claude take over after an initial "down-right spam" phase.

* Key Insight from User
"When the board becomes 'complicated' you need to exercise judgement; that's the goal of this"

* Current Status
- Best spam-only score: 1708 (using ~down_right_spam.sh~)
- Best Claude-assisted score: 332 (needs improvement!)
- The spam phase creates complex board states that require strategic thinking

* Approaches Tried

** 1. TTY-based (Current Focus)
- Direct TTY control via Python's pty module
- Can read board state and inject moves
- Successfully runs spam phase and shows board to Claude
- Challenge: Claude needs to analyze the actual board and make decisions

** 2. Board State Analysis
When shown a complex board like:
#+begin_example
Score: 332
|    4 |    2 |    4 |    2 |
|    2 |   16 |    8 |    4 |
|    4 |   32 |    4 |    2 |
|      |    8 |   32 |    8 |
#+end_example

Claude should:
1. Identify critical issues (two 32s not in corners, only 1 empty cell)
2. Plan strategic moves (merge the 8s, consolidate 32s)
3. Execute a sequence that progresses toward higher tiles

** 3. Key Technical Components
- ~tty_reader.py~: Captures game output via pseudo-terminal
- ~board_analyzer.py~: Calculates complexity scores (0-100)
- ~manual_test_runner.py~: Integrates components with GUID logging

* User Guidance
- "Don't overthink it" - avoid over-engineering
- Focus on TTY approach for now (not GDB yet)
- The goal is Claude exercising judgment on complex boards
- Commit frequently to help future AI agents understand the work

* Next Steps
1. Improve Claude's ability to analyze shown board states
2. Create better move sequences for complex positions
3. Test with longer spam phases to reach higher complexity
4. Eventually beat 1708 with Claude's strategic play

* Long-term Vision
While TTY is the minimal case, the eventual goal is debugger integration (GDB) for direct memory inspection and control. But for now, focus on making the TTY approach work well.

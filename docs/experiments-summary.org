* Key Discoveries

1. *Memory Layout*: The grid uses column-major indexing (grid[col][row])
2. *Timing*: 160ms built-in animation delay cannot be bypassed
3. *AI Scores*: Uniform distribution, not normal as expected
4. *Board Locking*: Down-right spam creates predictable locked states
5. *Process Control*: tmux + expect provides most reliable automation

* Experimental Methodology

Each experiment follows:
1. Clear hypothesis
2. Reproducible method (org-babel tangle)
3. Objective observations
4. Statistical analysis where applicable
5. Documented failures and lessons learned

* For Next Agent

Priority experiments to run:
1. *Exp 030*: Board complexity - has test data ready
2. *Exp 011*: Timing curves - builds on exp 009-010
3. *Exp 026-027*: Memory persistence - implementation ready

## Session Context

### Environment
- **Operating System**: macOS Darwin 24.1.0 (ARM64)

- **Working Directory**: `/Users/jasonwalsh/projects/jwalsh/2048`
- **Platform**: Claude Code (Anthropic's official CLI)
- **AI Model**: Claude Opus 4 (claude-opus-4-20250514)
- **Date**: June 24-25, 2025
- **Context Window**: Full session (~50k+ tokens of conversation and code)

### Project Repository
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/jwalsh/2048-cli-debug
- **Visibility**: Public (changed from private during session)
- **Collaborator Added**: seanjensengrey (admin)

## Session Achievements

### 1. Initial Exploration & Discovery
- Started with over-engineered debugger control frameworks
- User wisely redirected to simpler approaches
- Discovered the "academic" down-right strategy actually works!

### 2. The Great Random Key Mashing Experiment ðŸŽ²
- **Random Strategy**: "lkjlkjljlkjlkjlkjljlkjljq..." â†’ Score: 172
- **Down-Right Spam**: Academic heuristic â†’ Score: **1708!** 
- Successfully beat the 1000-point target
- Added triumphant screenshot to README

### 3. Python Project Setup
- Initialized proper Python project with `uv`
- Added dependencies: `click` and `numpy`
- Created package structure with entry points
- Set up virtual environment (Python 3.12)

### 4. TTY-Based Controller Implementation

#### Component 1: TTY Reader âœ…
```python
- Uses Python's pty module for pseudo-terminal control
- Captures game output with ANSI parsing
- Sends moves to game process
- Successfully tested reading board states
```

#### Component 2: Board Analyzer âœ…
```python
- Calculates complexity score (0-100)
- Factors: empty cells, tile positions, monotonicity, merge opportunities
- Provides strategy suggestions
- Tested on simple (37.5) and complex (68.3) boards
```

#### Component 3: Manual Test Runner âœ…
```python
- GUID-based test sessions
- Automated spam phase â†’ complexity checks â†’ manual inspection
- Comprehensive logging structure
- Successfully ran 100+ move tests
```

### 5. Documentation & Tracking
- Created 4 GitHub issues for different approaches:
  - Issue #3: Debugger control framework
  - Issue #4: Simple TTY player (original goal)
  - Issue #5: TTY implementation (completed!)
  - Issue #6: Debugger-based approach
  - Issue #7: Screen-based approach
  - Issue #8: Implementation decision

### 6. Git Workflow
- **Commits**: 15+ commits with conventional commit messages
- **Push Frequency**: After each component/milestone
- **Co-authorship**: Properly attributed with trailers
- **Real-time Updates**: GitHub issue comments at each milestone

### Key Metrics
- **High Score Achieved**: 1708 (from down-right spam)
- **Test Runs**: Multiple 100+ move sessions
- **Complexity Scores**: Ranged from 32.5 to 68.3
- **Success Rate**: 100% for component implementation

## Challenges & Solutions

1. **Over-engineering**: Started too complex, pivoted to simpler approach
2. **Path Issues**: Resolved with proper project structure
3. **Datetime Warnings**: Updated to timezone-aware datetime
4. **I/O Errors**: Added proper error handling for game termination

## Notable Moments

- User's wisdom: "i think you're solving a problem i'm trying not to solve"
- The "dumbest idea ever :D" (random key mashing) that led to insights
- Academic validation: Simple heuristics beat complex algorithms
- Real-time collaboration with GitHub issues and pushes

## Future Work

- Implement more sophisticated strategies
- Test with longer sessions to reach higher complexity
- Add the screen and debugger approaches
- Build MCP server for debugging as a service

## Conclusion

Successfully transformed from an over-engineered debugger framework to a practical, working TTY-based 2048 controller. The system now provides a solid foundation for automated gameplay with manual intervention points, comprehensive logging, and room for strategy improvements.

**Most Important Discovery**: Sometimes the dumbest solution (spam down and right) is the best solution - achieving 1708 points and proving that simple heuristics can be surprisingly effective!

Journey to TTY Control - Key Learnings:

FAILURES:
1. Shell scripts - timeout after 2min, can't maintain session
2. Python pty module - process dies with 'OSError: [Errno 5] Input/output error'
3. GNU screen - created session but couldn't capture output properly
4. Python abstractions - too many layers, lost direct control

SUCCESS:
- Expect works\! It's designed for exactly this use case
- Can see board state, send moves, maintain session

ODDITIES:
- Game score often shows 0 during spam phase (parsing issue?)
- Board state updates multiple times per move (animation frames)
- 'q' doesn't always quit cleanly
- Sometimes game process just dies after ~500 moves

KEY INSIGHT:
User: 'the goal is maybe 2000? i don't really care since you running an interactive program is the goal'
This isn't about the game - it's about learning program control\!

NEXT STEPS:
- Run spam until board complexity increases
- Claude takes over with strategic moves via expect
- Eventually move to GDB/LLDB for memory inspection

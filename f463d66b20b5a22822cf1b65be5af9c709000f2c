ODDITY: Score parsing in expect

During spam phase (first 500 moves), score consistently showed as 0 even though tiles were merging. Once Claude took control, scores started updating properly (12, 16, 28, etc.).

Possible causes:
1. Expect regex for score capture might be timing-sensitive
2. Rapid moves during spam might interfere with buffer capture
3. The expect_out buffer might not be updated correctly during fast moves

This doesn't affect gameplay but makes it hard to detect when board is truly 'difficult' based on score alone. May need to parse actual board tiles instead.

Summary: Successfully learned TTY control through expect\!

Starting point: 'Create TTY-based controller to play 2048'
Ending point: Working expect scripts that can spam and play strategically

Key achievements:
- Discovered expect as the right tool (after many failures)
- Created working scripts that maintain TTY session
- Reached 736 score with 64 tile (but no 2048 tile yet\!)
- Documented everything in CLAUDE.md for future sessions

The real victory: We can now control running programs through their TTY interface\!
Next: Apply this learning to other programs, eventually GDB/LLDB

User wisdom throughout:
- 'the goal is maybe 2000? i don't really care since you running an interactive program is the goal'
- 'remember basics: it's a tty; don't over think it'
- 'remember to keep committing'

And yes, the irony: We never made a 2048 tile in 2048\! ðŸ˜…

** RATIONALE
[Why this experiment matters and what gap it fills]
- What question does this answer?
- How does it build on previous work?
- What will we learn?

** METHOD
*** Setup
#+begin_src bash :tangle scripts/exp_XXX_setup.sh :shebang #!/bin/bash
# Environment preparation
echo "=== Experiment #XXX Setup ==="

# Clean environment
pkill -f relevant-process 2>/dev/null
tmux kill-server 2>/dev/null || true

# Build/prepare
make clean && make target
#+end_src

*** Data Collection
#+begin_src bash :tangle scripts/exp_XXX_collect.sh :shebang #!/bin/bash
# Main experiment script
echo "run,metric1,metric2,timestamp" > exp_XXX_results.csv

for run in {1..N}; do
    # Experiment logic here
    echo "$run,$METRIC1,$METRIC2,$(date +%s)" >> exp_XXX_results.csv
done
#+end_src

*** Analysis
#+begin_src python :tangle scripts/exp_XXX_analysis.py
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os

# Load and analyze results
csv_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../exp_XXX_results.csv')
df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)

# Statistical analysis
print("=== RESULTS ===")
print(f"Mean: {df['metric1'].mean()}")
print(f"Hypothesis test: {'PASS' if condition else 'FAIL'}")

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
# ... plotting code
output_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../exp_XXX_visualization.png')
plt.savefig(output_path)
#+end_src

** EXPECTED RESULTS

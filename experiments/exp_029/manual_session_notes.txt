# LLDB Manual Session for 2048 Debugging
# Date: 2025-06-25
# Goal: Learn memory inspection through manual play

# Start LLDB with our debug build
lldb ./2048-debug

# Set breakpoints at key functions
breakpoint set -n gamestate_tick
breakpoint set -n gamestate_new_block

# Run the game
run

# Commands to use during session:
# Continue execution: continue (or c)
# Print game state: print *g
# Print score: print g->score
# Print grid size: print g->gridsize
# Examine grid memory (16 ints for 4x4): memory read -f d -c 16 g->grid_data_ptr
# Print specific cell: print g->grid[0][0]
# Backtrace: bt
# List breakpoints: breakpoint list
# Delete breakpoint: breakpoint delete 1

# Phase 1: 20 turns of down-right spam
# Alternate between 's' (down) and 'd' (right)
# At each breakpoint, inspect memory

# Phase 2: 5 manual strategic moves
# Analyze board state carefully before each move
# Document reasoning for each move

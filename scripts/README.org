#+TITLE: Stable Scripts and Tools
#+DATE: [2025-06-25]

* Overview

This directory contains scripts and tools that have been promoted from experiments after proving their stability and usefulness.

* Promotion Criteria

Scripts are promoted from experiments/ to scripts/ when they:
1. Have been tested thoroughly in experiments
2. Provide a stable, well-defined interface
3. Are useful across multiple experiments
4. Have clear documentation
5. Handle errors gracefully

* Current Tools

** tty_manual/ (in root)
- *Status*: Stable Python package
- *Origin*: Experiments 001-002
- *Purpose*: TTY interaction framework
- *Interface*: ~TTYReader~, ~BoardAnalyzer~

** Candidates for Promotion

*** lldb_controller.py (exp_017)
- *Status*: Framework started, needs completion
- *Purpose*: Automated LLDB control
- *Interface*: ~LLDBController~ class
- *Blockers*: Needs more testing, error handling

*** Process Management (exp_006)
- *Status*: Cleanup scripts proven useful
- *Purpose*: Process hygiene
- *Candidate*: ~cleanup.sh~ emergency cleanup

*** Board State Capture (exp_003, exp_005)
- *Status*: Techniques proven
- *Purpose*: Simultaneous UI/memory capture
- *Needs*: Unified interface

* Future Interfaces

When these tools are ready for promotion, we might formalize them with:
- Pydantic models for data structures
- Type hints and contracts
- Formal specifications (TLA+, Lean)
- Property-based testing

* Usage Guidelines

Promoted scripts should:
- Have clear command-line interfaces
- Return standard exit codes
- Output parseable formats (JSON, CSV)
- Include --help documentation
- Handle common error cases
